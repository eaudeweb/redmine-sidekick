  # Specific Issue Meetings: If a meeting is about a specific issue with its own ticket, log all meeting time directly to that ticket.
  Example: A meeting clarifying a customer-reported problem that has a dedicated ticket.
  # General Meetings: For meetings that are not related to a specific issue (e.g., weekly meetings, daily meetings, status updates), log time to the general "Meetings" ticket.
  *Note: When logging meeting time, specify the activity as either Internal Meeting (team/company organized) or Customer Meeting (with clients).
